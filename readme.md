Commitments for Goals

As part of Cleo's mission to improve the worlds financial health, we are introducing Commitmentsfor Goals This will help users to get to their goals with the little things, a snack here or a little thing here and soon after you have reached a goal.

Install with git clone (repo address)
cd CleoHackathon
flutter fun -d chome for web

To use the app you will be first lead to chat to interact with the chat. You can also review and add new goals to track your progress with Goals.

We have written this with Dart using the Flutter framework which allows easy cross platform apps to deliver financial health around the world. We have also used fl_chart, google_fonts, cupertino_icons and provider to boost our app and to get where we are now.

Acknowledgements to the hard work of our team and our mentors from the Cleo. team in bringing this all together.
